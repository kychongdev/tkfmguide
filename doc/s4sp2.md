<summary>I can't survive in this stage</summary>

This stage is an RNG feast if you don't kill them fast. Ba'al hit 3rd position and Satan & Iblis hit randomly. Whenever your unit got focus fire by them, it's a certain death if you dont guard or shield. You can die even if you guard due to enemy have high attack buff when they are 50% hp below/others dead/ulted.

<summary>Why do Satan so hard to kill?</summary>

Satan have 50% less damage passive. The best turn to deal damage to her is during crazed (Take 50% more damage). You can bring Mina(55% more damage debuff) or Summer Shizuka (47.5% more damage debuff) to beat her down during non-crazed turn. She heal 5% hp after Ba'al is dead and 25% less damage buff after Iblis is dead.
