<summary>Why do I keep dying?</summary>

Ba'al buff her team everytime she ult. If you can't kill them fast enough, try killing Ba'al first (best before 12T). 
<br>
Satan move > Iblis move > Ba'al move. If you don't have shield to keep all unit in full hp, satan attack hit your unit and iblis [poison rose] will follow up on the same target.

<summary>Why does Satan so hard to kill?</summary>

Satan have 50% less damage passive. The best turn to deal damage to her is during crazed (Take 50% more damage). You can bring debuffer like Mina/S.Shizuka. She heal 5% hp after Ba'al is dead and 25% less damage buff after Iblis is dead. It's best to bring reduce healer like S.nana, Caesar or OG.Shizuka if you want to slowly grind her down.
